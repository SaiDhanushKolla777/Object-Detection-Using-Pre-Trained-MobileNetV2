# Object-Detection-Using-Pre-Trained-MobileNetV2
This project is a Flask-based web application for image recognition. It leverages the MobileNetV2 model, a pre-trained neural network from TensorFlow's Keras applications, to identify objects in images.


# Image Recognition Web Application

## Description
This project is a Flask-based web application for image recognition, utilizing TensorFlow's MobileNetV2 model to identify objects in images.

### Features
- **Flask Web Framework:** Built with Flask, a Python web framework.
- **Image Recognition:** Uses TensorFlow's pre-trained MobileNetV2 model.
- **User Interface:** Simple HTML and JavaScript frontend for image uploads and displaying results.

### How it Works
1. Upload an image via the web interface.
2. The image is processed by the Flask server.
3. MobileNetV2 model predicts the object in the image.
4. The prediction is displayed on the webpage.
